## How it works

Windows process hollowing works by creating a suspended process and writing the [shellcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellcode) over the entry point of the process's main thread. It then resumes the suspended process, which in turn executes the shellcode.

Linux process hollowing functions a little differently. First, the executable creates a child process by cloning itself. Then it overwrites the child process's [instruction pointer](https://datacadamia.com/computer/instruction/instruction_pointer) with shellcode. Because this process was not running before the attack, it is unlikely this will cause any issues on the victim machine.

## Using it

1. [Not shown in GIF] Generate shellcode for the desired end result (for example, use [msfvenom](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/shells/shells/msfvenom) to generate a reverse TCP shell shellcode for the target operating system)
2. [Not shown in GIF] Open [the config file](https://github.com/kmanc/remote_code_oxidation/blob/master/rco_config/src/lib.rs) 
and change the shellcode to the shellcode generated in step 1
3. [Not shown in GIF] Compile the executable

    #### Build for Linux target
    ```commandline
    cargo build -p process_hollowing --release
    ```

    #### Build for Windows target
    ```commandline
    cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu -p process_hollowing --release
    ```
4. Start a netcat listener on the attacking machine on the same port you configured the shellcode to connect to in step 1
    ```commandline
    nc -nlvp 4444
    ```   
5. Execute the payload on the victim machine
6. Return to the listener and enter desired commands for the victim machine to run
